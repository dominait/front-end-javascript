# SEARCH REST API  
You will use the Star Wars swapi api and search for results. You are going to implement basic filtering using categories. The build is an MVC implementation.

### Pre Fligh Check
__swapi api__  
As with all rest api's it will be helpful for you to have the documentation open. This api is relatively simple and all we are doing is searching the provided endpoints[swapi docs](https://swapi.dev/documentation#start)  

__.Babelrc__  
Because we are using the parcel bundler we need to tell the bundler how to handle and convert async functions to older forms of JavaScript. You will find a babelrc file in the project root. The file contains a plugin called _@babel/plugin-transform-runtime_ this does the conversion for us.

__.gitignore__  
Make sure to add the project files to a new github repository. Included is a .gitignore but you should fill it out with any files that you do not want to appear in the project repository. Go back and fill out the package.json file to reflect your git repo.

__Readme.md__  
You should also create a project Readme.md. When developers take a look at your github account one thing they look at is the repository readme file. It should be neet well formatted and give the developer all the pertinant infromation for the project.


### Install Node Modules
